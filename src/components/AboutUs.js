            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>The Mission of speech emotion recognition using machine learning is to develop and apply 
technology that can automatically identify and understand the emotional states expressed in spoken 
language.</p>

            <h1>Our vision</h1>
            <p>Emotions are fundamental to human communication and play a crucial role in conveying the 
speaker's intentions, attitudes, and feelings. Identifying and understanding these emotions from 
speech can enhance the quality of human-computer interactions and provide valuable insights into 
the emotional state of individuals. Machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning models, 
have made significant progress in this domain, allowing for more accurate and reliable speech emotion recognition.</p>
